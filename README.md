## Introduction

Each platform with microservice architecture has a web backend component. It just like a glue and tries to put everything
together in a simple fashion.
I1820 backend, it provides a single interface to all services.
It adds user management and authorization into the platform.
And at the end it hosts our web application that is written in Angular with :heart: and memory of someone who is not among us.

## Backend
Users must have an unique username in I1820 platform. Backend heavily uses JWT tokens for each of its works.

## User-Interface
The I1820 main user interface that users interact with it.

### Components
I think these component can help us in the way of development:

- [json formatter](https://github.com/mohsen1/json-formatter)
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
